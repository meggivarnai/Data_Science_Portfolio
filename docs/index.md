# Introduction 

Proficiency in data science is increasingly required for research and practice across a wide range of environmental science fields. In this class, we explore tools and best practices for working with large environmental databases primarily using the programming language R.  This bookdown website is comprised of all assignments completed in ESS 580A7.
